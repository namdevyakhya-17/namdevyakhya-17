# Hi there 👋  
I’m **Vyakhya Namdev** (GitHub: `namdevyakhya-17`)  
CSE-AIML @ Galgotias University | 3rd Year | Based in Greater Noida, India

## 🎯 About Me  
- I’m passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and full-stack development (especially MERN).  
- Currently exploring and building solutions in the healthcare domain, integrating data sharing, referrals, and analytics.  
- Always learning, always building — from speech-emotion recognition to deep-fake detection to e-commerce systems.  
- I believe in clean code, minimal changes approach (for my fellow developers), and that UI/UX matters just as much as backend logic.  

> “Minimal changes + deep understanding = better maintainability.”

## 🛠️ Current Projects  
Here are a few major repos you’ll find on my profile:

- **SpeechEmotionAndDeepFakeImageRecognition** – A hybrid system that detects human vs bot speech, classifies emotions & checks if video is deep-fake.  
- **SIH‑2024** (Project Code: SIH1620) – A city-wide healthcare integration platform featuring data sharing, central command, cross-hospital referrals & OPD queuing/bed availability modelling.  
- **E‑commerce‑Shopping‑System‑Public** – End-to-end e-commerce platform (frontend + backend) focused on practical architecture; note: AR dependency “Sceneform” was banned by Google, so AR part is pending.  
- **PawClassifier** – A deep learning notebook to classify pet images (dogs vs cats) and experiment with transfer-learning.  

Each project has its own README explaining architecture, setup, usage and future goals. Feel free to explore, use or contribute.

## 🎓 Education & Achievements  
- 12th Grade – To be added to my portfolio (stay tuned!)  
- Certified in AICTE Internship (Cohort 9) + Generative AI in Google Cloud.  
- Selected for Pre-Qualifiers & Round 3 of SIH 2024 with the project mentioned above.

## 🔭 What I’m Working On  
- Real-time audio recording + processing in my speech/emotion recognition system.  
- Extending the healthcare chatbot (built in Botpress) to better handle user intent without exact specialisation names, while maintaining conversational continuity.  
- Improving the UI with a bluish header background (my personal preference) and dynamic HTML/JavaScript driven content (i.e., no pre-filled data).  
- Researching literature around My main topics: DeepFake detection, Emotion recognition & Healthcare technology integration.

## 👯 Let’s Collaborate  
I’m open to:  
- Open-source contributions — especially if you’re working on ML, dashboards, health tech or full-stack apps.  
- Mentorship/Peer-collaboration — if you’re learning Python/Java/MERN and want to build something real.  
- Internship/Project opportunities in AI/ML & Healthcare domain.

## 🚀 Fun FACTS  
- I believe in **“small incremental improvements”** — whether in code, design, or project planning.  
- My favourite header background colour for projects? Bluish (#1E90FF or something close) 😄  
- I love solving coding problems (string splitting, linked lists, dynamic arrays with XORing & modulo) in my free time.  
- I started with dataset folders only (no CSV) for my speech-emotion project, now I’m on to integrating real-time recording & transcription.

Thanks for stopping by!  
Let’s build something amazing together 👨‍💻
